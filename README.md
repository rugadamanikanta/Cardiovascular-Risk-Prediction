# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 3390 records and 15 attributes

## Data Description

**Tot Chol**: total cholesterol level (Continuous)

**Sys BP**: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)

**Dia BP**: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)

**BMI**: Body Mass Index (Continuous)

**Heart Rate**: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)

**Glucose**: glucose level (Continuous) Predict variable (desired target)

**10-year risk of coronary heart disease CHD(binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”) - DV**
